    description: "DCP Enhancement with bincode serialization compatibility: tagged serde enums (serde(tag=type)) are incompatible with bincode deserialization (deserialize_any not supported). Config structs that must serialize to both TOML and bincode should use flat structs with string mode fields instead of tagged enums."
    evidence: "TopologyConfig initially implemented as tagged enum caused 4 snapshot persistence test failures. Changed to flat struct with mode: String field to support both TOML and bincode."
    status: acted_on
    root_cause_analysis:
      symptom: "bincode deserialization fails on serde tagged enums with deserialize_any error"
      root_cause: "serde tagged enums require deserialize_any which bincode does not implement; config types that participate in both human-readable (TOML/JSON) and binary (bincode) serialization need enum-free representations"
