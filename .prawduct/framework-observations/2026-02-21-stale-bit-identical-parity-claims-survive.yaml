    severity: warning
    description: "Stale bit-identical parity claims survive after intentional native weather divergence: native_eval.rs trait doc (line 7), nonfunctional-requirements.md (lines 27, 53), and test_tracking.test_files missing native_weather.rs. Three Critic checks flagged these as warnings."
    evidence: "Critic findings: Spec Compliance warning (NFR claims test exists that was removed, native_eval.rs claims bit-identical), Scope Discipline warning (NFR lines 27/53 reference removed test), Coherence warning (3 stale bit-identical references survive)"
    status: noted
    root_cause_analysis:
      symptom: "Documentation and code comments claim bit-identical native-vs-Rhai parity after the behavior was intentionally changed to allow divergence"
      root_cause: "When a behavioral decision changes (bit-identical parity dropped), artifact updates and code doc comments are not mechanically linked to the decision — they require manual identification and update"
